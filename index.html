        <p>Roller skating is traveling on surfaces with roller skates. Roller skate bearings reduce friction in the same way, allowing a skater to glide smoothly around corners with little effort. Bearings are made to withstand high pressure and last for millions of revolutions, which means you can keep on rolling for years to come</p>
